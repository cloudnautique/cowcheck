cowcheck
========

A microservice for checking the health of a Rancher node. 
Presents an HTTP interface on port `5050` for querying health status.
Calling `/` or `/health` will return `200 OK` when healthy and `503 Service Unavailable` when one
or more of its checks were unhealthy in the most recent evaluation cycle. Additionally, a prometheus 
endpoint can be found at `/metrics`. See Prometheus section below.

## How to use
Run this as a container on each Rancher host that runs your containers. It will assert 
basic functionality of the Rancher stack is working such as DNS, Metadata API. When combined
with a fleet management service such as AWS Auto Scale Groups or Google Cloud Deployment Manager 
you can replace nodes automatically when they fail. Alternatively you can just monitor and alert 
by polling the endpoint periodically.  

## What does it check/monitor? 

* Rancher Metadata API
* Rancher DNS
* Disk space available on the node (both container data space and Docker/Moby metadata space)
                                                              
### Prometheus Endpoint
Provides a metric representation of health through the metric `cowcheck_node_health`. 
Endpoint is available at `/metrics` on port `5050`. The metric will be set to `0` 
when healthy and `1` when unhealthy.

## Configuration options

* `POLL_INTERVAL`: Time in seconds between evaluating checks
* `LOG_LEVL`: Level of logging verbosity
* `ENABLE_STORAGE_CHECK`: Enable storage check by setting to `true`. Disabled by default. Currently only supports `devicemapper` storage driver.
* `DATA_SPACE_THRESHOLD`: Minimum amount of storage in bytes before failing storage checks.
* `METADATA_SPACE_THRESHOLD`: Minimum amount of storage in bytes before failing storage checks.
* `DOCKER_API_VERSION`: The version of the Docker API to use when connecting to the local docker daemon (only for storage checks)

## Building

To build the binary:
`make build`

To create a Docker image: 
`make package`


## Running

`docker run --net=host -p 5050:5050 [image name]`

Or schedule with [Rancher](http://rancher.com) to run on all hosts as a 
[Global Service](https://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.6/en/cattle/scheduling/#global-service) (cattle) 
or [Daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) (kubernetes).
