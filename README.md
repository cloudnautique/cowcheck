========

A microservice for checking the health of a Rancher node. 
Presents an HTTP interface on port `5050` for querying health status.
Will return `200 OK` when healthy and `503 Service Unavailable` when one
or more of its checks were unhealthy in the most recent evaluation cycle.

## How to use
Run this as a container on each Rancher host that runs your containers. It will assert 
basic functionality of the Rancher stack is working such as DNS, Metadata API. When combined
with a fleet management service such as AWS Auto Scale Groups or Google Cloud Deployment Manager 
you can replace nodes automatically when they fail. Alternatively you can just monitor and alert 
by polling the endpoint periodically.
